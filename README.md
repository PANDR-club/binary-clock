# Binary clock 2023-2024

This project was a simple binary clock that we began building as the PandR project in the 2023-2024 school year. 

It taught those who attended the club a lot about both electronics and programming, using shift-registors, RTCs and microcontrollers. Whilest we never finished the clock, it was still used by members as their project for their Arkwright application, where 50% of the students who applied got their fully funded scholarship.

Initial prototype (which we used to help understand how we can program GPIO pins and use the ESP32's RTC):

Shift registor demo I built to visually show members of the club how such an IC works:
